# Task: Flea circus

A 30Ã—30 grid of squares contains 900 fleas, initially one flea per square.
When a bell is rung, each flea jumps to an adjacent square at random (usually 4 possibilities, except for fleas on the edge of the grid or at the corners).

What is the expected number of unoccupied squares after 50 rings of the bell? Give your answer rounded to six decimal places.

Implementation plan

 - Implement single simulation
 - Run multiple simulations and calculate average
 - Run simulations in parallel
 - Optimize for better speed, less memory allocations (Not done yet)

## Usage

Build the project first

```sh
go build -o fleas
```

Run single simulation
```sh
./fleas --times=1
```

Run multple simulations in sequence
```sh
./fleas --times=10
```

Run multple simulations in parallel
```sh
./fleas --times=10 --parallel=true
```

Run `./fleas --help` to see details:
```
Usage of ./fleas:
  -parallel
        Determines if simulation should run in parallel
  -times int
        Number of times to run simulation (default 1)
```

NOTE: after simulation was run `debug.log` file is created with resources usage details
